# Blockchain
This project simulates a blockchain based on Bitcoin's cryptographic puzzle using Golang's native channels and routines in a synchronous netowrk.
##Input and Output
The user will input the number of miners, blocks, and processes being ran. As well as the difficulty of the cryptographic puzzle. The difficulty is defined as how many leading zeroes need to be present in the proposed hash.

##How to Run:

####Step 1: Clone Git Repository

Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/SebastianFernandez1999/Blockchain`

####Step 2: Run using go run *.go

####Step 4: Input number of miners, blocks, processes, and difficulty.
